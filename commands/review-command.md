# Review

A comprehensive personal productivity review system that processes tasks, calendar, notes, and journaling using integrated tools.

This command guides you through a systematic review process, checking each item individually and waiting for confirmation before proceeding to the next step.

---

## Review Preparation

I'll read your recent journal entries (last 7 days minimum) to understand what has changed since the previous review. I'll pay special attention to "Items to Follow Up Next Review" from the last review session and note the date/time of the previous review to help identify what's new or changed.

*Note: Configure your journal location in your CLAUDE.md file for this to work properly.*

**Ready to proceed?** I'll check your recent journal files now.

## Clear the Decks

**Manual Tasks for You:**
- Process personal email, work email inbox, slack messages, and github inbox to zero items (I'll confirm you've completed this)

**Todoist Inbox Check:**
I'll check your Todoist inbox for tasks that need to be processed. The goal is to ensure there are no unprocessed tasks in your Todoist inbox.

**Ready for the next step?**

## Core Review

**Today's and Overdue Tasks:**
I'll review any incomplete tasks planned for today and any overdue tasks. If it's morning, I'll assume you still have time to complete today's tasks.

**Meeting Notes Processing:**
I'll search your Google Drive for any new documents since our last review that appear to be meeting summaries or meeting transcripts. I'll review them and suggest any tasks you need to create, delegations that need reminders, or calendar items to add.

**@NOW Tasks Review:**
I'll review all tasks tagged with @NOW to ensure you have a good plan to accomplish everything this week. I'll pay special attention to tasks that don't have a specific day and priority attached.

**Project Health Check:**
I'll review existing projects to ensure they have clearly identified "next actions". Projects should generally have at least one @NOW or @NEXT task. If they don't, I'll ask if the project still needs to exist or needs updating.

**Ready to continue?**

## Look Ahead

**Tomorrow's Task Review:**
I'll review Todoist tasks scheduled for tomorrow. As a guideline, each day should have two top priority tasks and up to eight 2nd priority tasks.

**Calendar Check:**
I'll check your Google Calendar for tomorrow's schedule and determine if any preparation or schedule adjustments are required for conflicts or new priorities. I'll ignore any events marked as "tentative" since those are informational only.

**Time Blocking Decision:**
Based on tomorrow's tasks and calendar, I'll help you decide if you need to create time blocks for tomorrow's work.

**Ready for the final section?**

## Journaling

**Review Previous Entries:**
I'll review your journal entries from the last 30 days to identify anything you currently need to be reminded about or ideas that should be resurfaced that haven't been covered in this review.

**Capture New Information:**
I'll ask you for any thoughts, ideas, important events, or notes that we should save in today's journal entry.

**Create Today's Entry:**
I'll create or update today's journal entry using the enhanced format:
- Review Session tracking
- Review Completed actions  
- Action Items Created
- Items to Follow Up Next Review
- Key Metrics Snapshot
- Notes

I'll include specific follow-up items for the next review based on what was discussed or identified during this session.
