# Task Inspection

Reviews current tasks, overdue items, and weekly priorities using Todoist integration.

---

## Current Commitments
- Review any incomplete tasks planned for today and any overdue tasks. Use the time of the day to influence your judgement about whether or not I'm overcommitted. For example, if it's the morning, assume that I still have time to complete the today's tasks.
- Review tasks tagged with `@NOW`. This tag is used for tasks that should be completed in the current calendar week. Ensure I have a good plan to accomplish everything this week. Pay special attention to tasks that do not have a specific day and priority attached. Ideally, each `@NOW` task should have a day assigned to it, but that is not a firm requirement.

## Task system integrity rules
- Tasks with the `@NEXT` tag are planned for the next calendar week, not this week. This is the default tagging for new tasks. Projects should generally have at least one `@NOW` or `@NEXT` task in them. This helps ensure that projects have a clear path forward. Review existing projects in the interest of ensuring they have a clearly identified "next action". If they don't, it's reasonable to ask if the project still needs to exist or if it needs to be updated. If you need more information about the project itself the `/project-analysis` command can help.

## Upcoming Commitments
- Review Todoist tasks that are scheduled for the upcoming calendar day. As a soft guideline, each calendar day should have two top priority tasks and up to eight 2nd priority tasks.
