# /list-gdocs

## Purpose
Streamlined command to search and list Google Docs files relevant for context loading, eliminating trial and error in document discovery.

## Usage
```
/list-gdocs [pageSize]
```

**Parameters:**
- `pageSize` (optional): Number of documents to return (default: 20, max: 100)

## What it does

### Simple Document Search
Searches Google Drive for all files and returns a list of documents, prioritizing:
- Most recent documents first
- Includes document titles, types, and IDs
- Shows both Google Docs and other file types for comprehensive visibility
- Highlights meeting notes (especially those generated by Gemini) as high priority for review

## Command Implementation

When this command is invoked:

1. **Search all documents:**
   ```
   mcp__gdrive__gdrive_search("*", pageSize)
   ```

2. **Present simple list:**
   - Document ID, title, and file type
   - Sorted by most recent
   - Highlight meeting notes (especially Gemini-generated ones) for priority review
   - No filtering or analysis - just raw search results with meeting note callouts

## Example Output Format

```

## Integration with Review Workflow

This command replaces step 19 in review.md:
- Instead of: "Search Google Drive and share relevant findings"
- Use: `/list-gdocs 7` (or appropriate day range)
- Provides structured, actionable document summary
- Eliminates manual search trial and error

## Customization Options

The command can be extended with:
- Custom search keywords for specific project types
- Integration with calendar to find meeting-related documents
- Filtering by shared vs. personal documents
- Different time ranges for different review types (daily vs. weekly)
