# Task Inspection

Inspects Todoist to gain a detailed understanding of my current project committments.

## Project descriptions
- Projects in my Todoist should each have an uncompletable task called "DESCRIPTION" which is used to describe the project's purpose. You should read these descriptions to gain a clear understanding of the goal or purpose of a project.
- There is a top-level project called "AREAS OF FOCUS" which contains subprojects that contain tasks. These are not traditional projects, but hold tasks related to areas of my life that require attention to tasks that I need or want to accomplish from time to time. They usually do not have a DESCRIPTION because these projects do not have an outcome. Sometimes, tasks from an AREA OF FOCUS can become it's own project.
- If a project's purpose is unclear, ask me for clarity so we can update the description.
- There is a top-level project called "LISTS". You should always ignore this project and any of it's child projects. It is not for productivity tasks. It is just for holding lists on various topics unrelated to any personal productivity.

## Project task analysis
- Always ignore subtasks.
- When displaying tasks to me in chat, always make sure to show the project associated with it.
- There is a project called REMINDERS. It holds one-off tasks that I want to be reminded about on a certain date. Every task in this project must have a date attached to it. If you encounter a task in this project that has no date, alert me.
