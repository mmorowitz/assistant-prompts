# Weekly Review
Do not batch/group tasks in this checklist when reviewing them with me. Ask about each individually and wait for confirmation until we move to the next one. You may group things within one step (such as a group of tasks that all need review).

## Review Preparation
- [ ] Read the past week's worth of journal entries (last 7 days) including the last weekly review, to understand what has changed since the previous. Pay attention to "Items to Follow Up Next Review" from the last review session.
- [ ] Note the date/time of the previous review to help identify what's new or changed.

## Clear the decks
- [ ] Collect loose papers, receipts, and notes
- [ ] Process personal email, work email inbox, slack messages, and github inbox to zero items. I will do this manually. Your job is to confirm that I've done it all. (This is one task to confirm).
- [ ] Review, backup, and clear phone photos.
- [ ] Review any lingering items from the past week's journals that should be thought about and/or processed into tasks or meetings.
- [ ] Empty your head - brain dump any lingering thoughts or commitments

## Get Current
- [ ] Review all the tasks in the @NOW label in Todoist and determine where to put anything that's still there
- [ ] Review all the tasks in the @NEXT label in Todoist and determin if should move them to @NOW for the upcoming week
- [ ] Review all tasks in the @LATER label and determine if any are candidates for @NOW or @NEXT
- [ ] Check my @WAITING list and determine if any action needs to be taken on tasks that were delegated
- [ ] Review @SOMEDAY list for items that might now be relevant to act on

## Review Projects
- [ ] Review all work and personal projects. Update notes and tasks if necessary. Ensure that each project has at leat one clear next action either labeled @NOW or @NEXT
- [ ] Identify any stalled projects and determine what's needed to move forward
- [ ] Review project outcomes and ensure they're still relevant and clear
- [ ] Add any new projects that emerged during the week
- [ ] Archive or remove any completed projects or projects that are no longer relevant
- [ ] Review all Areas of Focus. Determine if there are tasks that need to be addressed in the coming week. Brainstorm any new ideas that can be added to these lists.

## Look Ahead
- [ ] Review next week's calendar and identify key priorities or needs. Also review my personal calendar for outside commitments (I will do this part manually since you do not have access to my personal calendar).
- [ ] Review the @NOW label again. Determine which of them need to be completed on a certain day and apply that day and mark it top priority.
- [ ] Review tomorrow's task prioritization specifically. Set the top two priorities for the day.
- [ ] Schedule any needed preparation time for big meetings or projects or any other focused work blocks.
- [ ] Plan any personal time, exercise, or other time for areas of focus.

## Weekly Reflection
- [ ] Ask me for any thoughts, ideas, important events, or notes that we should save in the journal for the week.
- [ ] Include specific follow-up items for the next review based on what was discussed or identified during this session.
