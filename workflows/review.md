# Review
Do not batch/group tasks in this checklist when reviewing them with me. Ask about each individually and wait for confirmation until we move to the next one. You may group things within one step (such as a group of tasks that all need review).

## Before Starting Review
1. Read this entire workflow document first
2. Note that each [ ] item requires user confirmation before proceeding
3. Set expectation: this is interactive, not automated

## Review Preparation
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Read the most recent journal entries (last 7 days minimum) to understand what has changed since the previous review. Pay attention to "Items to Follow Up Next Review" from the last review session. Ask user if they want details before proceeding.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Note the date/time of the previous review to help identify what's new or changed. Share findings and wait for confirmation.

## Clear the decks
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Confirm user has processed personal email, work email inbox, slack messages, and github inbox to zero items. Wait for confirmation before proceeding.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Check my Todoist inbox for tasks that need to be processed. Share findings and wait for user response before continuing.

## Core review
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review any incomplete tasks planned for today and any overdue tasks. Share findings and wait for user input before proceeding.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review any meeting output or notes that need to be processed. Use `/review-docs` command to search Google Drive, then read relevant documents and share findings. Wait for user response before continuing.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review tasks tagged with @NOW and ensure I have a good plan to accomplish everything this week. Share analysis and recommendations, then wait for confirmation.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review existing projects for clearly identified "next action". Share any projects that need attention and wait for user direction.

## Look ahead
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review Todoist tasks scheduled for the upcoming calendar day. Share task load analysis and wait for user input.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Check Google calendar for the appropriate day's schedule. Share any preparation needs or conflicts, then wait for user response.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Ask if user needs help creating time blocks for the next day's work. Wait for their decision.

## Journaling
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Review previous journal entries from the last 30 days. Share any important reminders or ideas that should be resurfaced, then wait for user response.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Ask for any thoughts, ideas, important events, or notes that should be saved in the journal. Wait for user input.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Create or update today's journal entry. Share the draft and wait for user approval before finalizing.
- [ ] **STOP AND WAIT** - Confirm specific follow-up items for the next review based on this session. Get user agreement before ending.
