# Review
Do not batch/group tasks in this checklist when reviewing them with me. Ask about each individually and wait for confirmation until we move to the next one. You may group things within one step (such as a group of tasks that all need review).

## Review Preparation
- [ ] Read the most recent journal entries (last 7 days minimum) to understand what has changed since the previous review. Pay attention to "Items to Follow Up Next Review" from the last review session.
- [ ] Note the date/time of the previous review to help identify what's new or changed.

## Clear the decks
- [ ] Process personal email, work email inbox, slack messages, and github inbox to zero items. I will do this manually. Your job is to confirm that I've done it all. (This is one task to confirm)
- [ ] Check my Todoist inbox for tasks that need to be processed. My goal is to make sure there are no tasks in my Todoist inbox.

## Core review
- [ ] Review any incomplete tasks planned for today and any overdue tasks. If it's the morning, assume that I still have time to complete the today's tasks.
- [ ] Review any meeting output or notes that need to be processed. Search my Google Drive using these steps: 1) First search with query "*" and pageSize=50 to get recent documents, 2) Filter results to identify Google Docs (application/vnd.google-apps.document) from the last 3-7 days, particularly those with "Notes by Gemini" or meeting-related titles, 3) When many documents exist, prioritize by recency and direct relevance to my work, 4) Read relevant meeting documents and suggest any tasks I need to do now or create for later or delegations that I need reminders for. You may make task or reminder suggestions to add to Todoist or suggest that I add something to my calendar.
- [ ] Review tasks tagged with @NOW and ensure I have a good plan to accomplish everything this week. Pay special attention to tasks that do not have a specific day and priority attached.
- [ ] Review existing projects in the interest of ensuring they have a clearly identified "next action". Projects should generally have at least one @NOW or @NEXT task in them. If they don't, it's reasonable to ask if the project still needs to exist or if it needs to be updated.

## Look ahead
- [ ] Review Todoist tasks that are scheduled for the upcoming calendar day. As a soft guideline, each calendar day should have two Priority 4 (highest) tasks and up to eight Priority 2-3 tasks.
- [ ] Check my Google calendar for the appropriate day's schedule and determine if any preparation or schedule adjustment is required for conflicts or new priorities. **Calendar day guidance**: If reviewing in the morning (before ~11 AM), focus on today's schedule. If reviewing later in the day (after ~3 PM), focus on tomorrow's schedule. If unsure which day to prioritize or the timing is ambiguous, ask me which day's schedule to review.
- [ ] Help me decide if I need to create time blocks for the next day's work.

## Journaling
- [ ] Review previous journal entries from the last 30 days and determine if there's anything that I currently need to be reminded about or ideas that you feel you should resurface that hasn't been covered in my review.
- [ ] Ask me for any thoughts, ideas, important events, or notes that we should save in the journal.
- [ ] Create or update today's journal entry using the enhanced format: Review Session tracking, Review Completed actions, Action Items Created, Items to Follow Up Next Review, Key Metrics Snapshot, and Notes.
- [ ] Include specific follow-up items for the next review based on what was discussed or identified during this session.
